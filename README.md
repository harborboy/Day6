1. border-top-color: The border-top-color CSS property sets the color of the top border of an element.
2. border-color: The border-color CSS property is a shorthand for setting the color of the four sides of an element's border.
3. font-size: The font-size CSS property specifies the size of the font.
4.text-shadow: The text-shadow CSS property adds shadows to text. It accepts a comma-separated list of shadows to be applied to the text and text-decorations of the element.
5. color: The CSS color property sets the foreground color of an element's text content, and its decorations. It doesn't affect any other characteristic of the element; it should really be called text-color and would have been named so, save for historical reasons and its appearance in CSS Level 1.
